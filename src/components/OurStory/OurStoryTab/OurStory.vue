            We are passionate about making our socks here and we also care
            deeply about where our raw materials come from. We know who we're
            working with every step of the way. Our employees and factories are
            kind, hard-working people in the south of Vietnam.
          </p>
          <p>
            Partnering with manufacturing companies here at home allows us to
            ensure our socks are some of the most comfortable, durable, and
            environmentally friendly socks around.
